others.

## Quick Start 

With the purpose of test tsuru and/or for development, you can use [installer](https://docs.tsuru.io/master/experimental/installer.html) to have tsuru up and running. Installer is an experimental feature. 

### From Binary

#### Getting tsuru-client 

Download the latest release for your platform at: https://github.com/tsuru/tsuru-client/releases/

Example for release 1.1.1 and OS X.

```
$ curl -sSL https://github.com/tsuru/tsuru-client/releases/download/1.1.1/tsuru-1.1.1-darwin_amd64.tar.gz \
  | tar xz
```

#### Call tsuru installer

```
$ tsuru install
```

### From Source

#### Getting tsuru-client 

You need to have [Go](https://golang.org/doc/install) properly installed in your machine.

```
$ git clone github.com/tsuru/tsuru-client $GOPATH/src/github.com/tsuru/tsuru-client
$ cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/tsuru/tsuru-client
$ make install
```

#### Create an installer config

Create a file called local.yml with this content:

```
components:
    tsuru:
        version: latest
```

#### Call tsuru installer

```
$ tsuru install -c local.yml
```

### Testing

If everything's gone well you have the tsuru running on a virtualbox. 
Call app-list to see tsuru working, this command needs to return one app called tsuru-dashboard.

```
$ tsuru app-list
```
