Overview
========

The `Open Service Broker API <https://www.openservicebrokerapi.org/>`_ project allows developers, ISVs, and SaaS vendors a single, 
simple, and elegant way to deliver services to applications running within cloud native platforms. 

Tsuru supports services provided by a service broker since version 1.6.0. Service brokers may be registered on the tsuru API to make
their services available for applications running on the platform. Users can create instances from these services, bind and unbind those instances
as if they were tsuru native services. 

The next section explains how service brokers are managed by tsuru admins. The usage of services fromm those brokers do not differ from regular
tsuru services, except for the support for instance creation and binding parameters.

Managing Service Brokers
========================

To expose services from a broker, a tsuru admin needs to add the service broker endpoint to the tsuru api. This can be done on the cli.

.. highlight:: bash

::

    $ tsuru service broker add <name> <url> --token <token>

.. note::

    Refer to the command help documentation to a full list of parameters that may be set for the broker.

After adding a service broker, its services are going to be displayed just as any native tsuru service. The output below shows
the list displayed after adding the `AWS Service Broker <https://github.com/awslabs/aws-servicebroker>`_.

.. highlight:: bash

::

    $ tsuru service list

The name of each service is prefixed with the name of the broker that provides the service ("aws" in this case). 
tsuru will cache the service catalog returned by the service broker for a few minutes (configurable by broker).

OSB services support creation and binding parameters. Available parameters are displayed using the ``tsuru service info`` command:

.. highlight:: bash

::

    $ tsuru service info aws::dh-route53
    Info for "aws::dh-route53"

    Documentation:
    AWS Service Broker - Amazon Route 53

An instance of this service may be created using the cli:

.. highlight:: bash

::

    $ tsuru service instance add aws::dh-route53 recordset --plan-param region=us-west-1 --plan-param aws_secret_key=XPTO

Binding, unbinding and removing the instance follows the same pattern and works just as other native services. Environment variables
returned by the service are going to also be injected into the application.

Removing a service broker may also be done by the cli:

.. highlight:: bash

::

    $ tsuru service broker delete <name>
