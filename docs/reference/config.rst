tsuru.conf reference
++++++++++++++++++++

tsuru uses a configuration file in `YAML <http://www.yaml.org/>`_ format. This
document describes what each option means, and how it should look.

Notation
========

tsuru uses a colon to represent nesting in YAML. So, whenever this document says
something like ``key1:key2``, it refers to the value of the ``key2`` that is
nested in the block that is the value of ``key1``. For example,
``database:url`` means:

.. highlight:: yaml

::

    database:
      url: <value>

tsuru configuration
===================

This section describes tsuru's core configuration. Other sections will include
configuration of optional components, and finally, a full sample file.

HTTP server
-----------

tsuru provides a REST API, that supports HTTP and HTTP/TLS (a.k.a. HTTPS). Here
are the options that affect how tsuru's API behaves:

listen
++++++

``listen`` defines in which address tsuru webserver will listen. It has the
form <host>:<port>. You may omit the host (example: ``:8080``). This setting
has no default value.

shutdown-timeout
++++++++++++++++

``shutdown-timeout`` defines how many seconds to wait when performing an api
shutdown (by sending SIGTERM or SIGQUIT). Defaults to 600 seconds.

use-tls
+++++++

``use-tls`` indicates whether tsuru should use TLS or not. This setting is
optional, and defaults to "false".

tls:listen
++++++++++

If both this and ``listen`` keys are set (following the same rules as ``listen``
key), tsuru will start two webserver instances: one with HTTP on ``listen``
address, and the other one with HTTPS on ``tls:listen`` address.
If only one of ``listen`` and ``tls:listen`` keys is set (and ``use-tls`` is
true), tsuru will only run the TLS supporting webserver. This setting is
optional, unless ``use-tls`` is true.

tls:cert-file
+++++++++++++

``tls:cert-file`` is the path to the X.509 certificate file configured to serve
the domain.  This setting is optional, unless ``use-tls`` is true.

tls:key-file
++++++++++++

``tls:key-file`` is the path to private key file configured to serve the
domain. This setting is optional, unless ``use-tls`` is true.

tls:auto-reload:interval
++++++++++++++++++++++++

``tls:auto-reload:interval`` defines the time frequency which the TLS 
certificates are reloaded by the webserver. A new certificate only is loaded
when there is difference between newer and older.

This setting is optional. The default value is 0, which means automatic reload
is not enabled. To enable it, you could use any `time.Duration <https://golang.org/pkg/time/#Duration>`_
value greater than zero, as well as `parseable values <https://golang.org/pkg/time/#ParseDuration>`_
as: "1h", "60m", "3600s", etc.

server:read-timeout
+++++++++++++++++++

``server:read-timeout`` is the timeout of reading requests in the server. This
is the maximum duration of any request to the tsuru server.

This is useful to avoid leaking connections, in case clients drop the
connection before end sending the request. The default value is 0, meaning no
timeout.

server:write-timeout
++++++++++++++++++++

``server:write-timeout`` is the timeout of writing responses in the server.

This is useful to avoid leaking connections, in case clients drop the
connection before reading the response from tsuru. The default value is 0,
meaning no timeout.

server:app-log-buffer-size
++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The maximum number of received log messages from applications to hold in memory
waiting to be sent to the log database. The default value is 500000.


disable-index-page
++++++++++++++++++

tsuru API serves an index page with some basic instructions on how to use the
current target. It's possible to disable this page by setting the
``disable-index-page`` flag to true. It's also possible to customize which
template will be used in the index page, see the next configuration entry for
more details.

This setting is optional, and defaults to ``false``.

index-page-template
+++++++++++++++++++

``index-page-template`` is the template that will be used for the index page.
It must use the `Go template syntax <http://golang.org/pkg/text/template/>`_,
and tsuru will provide the following variables in the context of the template:

    - ``tsuruTarget``: the target URL of the tsuru API serving the index page
    - ``userCreate``: a boolean indicating whether user registration is enabled
      or disabled
    - ``nativeLogin``: a boolean indicating whether the API is configured to
      use the native authentication scheme
    - ``keysEnabled``: a boolean indicating whether the API is configured to
      manage SSH keys

It will also include a function used for querying configuration values, named
``getConfig``. Here is an example of the function usage:

.. highlight:: html

::

    <body>
        {{if getConfig "use-tls"}}
        <p>we're safe</p>
        {{else}}
        <p>we're not safe</p>
        {{end}}
    </body>

This setting is optional. When ``index-page-template`` is not defined, tsuru
will use the `default template
<https://github.com/tsuru/tsuru/blob/master/api/index_templates.go>`__.

reset-password-template
+++++++++++++++++++++++

``reset-password-template`` is the template that will be used to "password reset" email.
It must use the `Go template syntax <http://golang.org/pkg/text/template/>`_,
and tsuru will provide the following variables in the context of the template:

    - ``Token``: a string, the id of password reset request
    - ``UserEmail``: a string, the user email
    - ``Creation``: a time, when password reset was requested
    - ``Used``: a boolean, reset-password was done or not

This setting is optional. When ``reset-password-template`` is not defined, tsuru
will use the `default template <https://github.com/tsuru/tsuru/blob/master/auth/native/data.go>`__.

reset-password-successfully-template
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

``reset-password-successfully-template`` is the template that will be used to email with new password, after reset.
It must use the `Go template syntax <http://golang.org/pkg/text/template/>`_,
and tsuru will provide the following variables in the context of the template:

    - ``password``: a string, the new password
    - ``email``: a string, the user email

This setting is optional. When ``reset-password-template`` is not defined, tsuru
will use the `default template <https://github.com/tsuru/tsuru/blob/master/auth/native/data.go>`__.

Database access
---------------

tsuru uses MongoDB as a database manager to store information like users,
machines, containers, etc. You need to describe how tsuru will connect to your
database server. Therefore, it's necessary to provide a `MongoDB connection
string <https://docs.mongodb.org/manual/reference/connection-string/>`_.
Database related options are listed below:

database:url
++++++++++++

``database:url`` is the database connection string. It is a mandatory setting
and it has no default value. Examples of strings include basic ``127.0.0.1`` and
more advanced ``mongodb://user:password@127.0.0.1:27017/database``. Please refer
to `MongoDB documentation
<http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/reference/connection-string/>`_ for more details
and examples of connection strings.

database:name
+++++++++++++

``database:name`` is the name of the database that tsuru uses. It is a
mandatory setting and has no default value. An example of value is "tsuru".

database:driver
+++++++++++++++

``database:driver`` is the name of the database driver that tsuru uses.
Currently, the only value supported is "mongodb".

.. _config_logdb:

database:logdb-url
++++++++++++++++++

This setting is optional. If ``database:logdb-url`` is specified, tsuru will use
it as the connection string to the MongoDB server responsible for storing
application logs. If this value is not set, tsuru will use ``database:url``
instead.

This setting is useful because tsuru may have to process a very large number of
log messages depending on the number of units deployed and applications
behavior. Every log message will trigger a insertion in MongoDB and this may
negatively impact the database performance. Other measures will be implemented
in the future to improve this, but for now, having the ability to use an
exclusive database server for logs will help mitigate the negative impact of log
writing.

database:logdb-name
+++++++++++++++++++

This setting is optional. If ``database:logdb-name`` is specified, tsuru will
use it as the database name for storing application logs. If this value is not
set, tsuru will use ``database:name`` instead.

Email configuration
-------------------

tsuru sends email to users when they request password recovery. In order to send
those emails, tsuru needs to be configured with some SMTP settings. Omitting
these settings won't break tsuru, but users will not be able to reset their
password.

smtp:server
+++++++++++

The SMTP server to connect to. It must be in the form <host>:<port>. Example:
"smtp.gmail.com:587".

smtp:user
+++++++++

The user to authenticate with the SMTP sever. Currently, tsuru requires
authenticated sessions.

smtp:password
+++++++++++++

The password for authentication within the SMTP server.

Repository configuration
------------------------

tsuru optionally uses `Gandalf <https://github.com/tsuru/gandalf>`_ to manage
git repositories. Gandalf exposes a REST API for repositories management and
tsuru needs information about the Gandalf HTTP server endpoint.

repo-manager
++++++++++++

``repo-manager`` represents the repository manager that tsuru-server should use.
For backward compatibility reasons, the default value is "gandalf". Users can
disable repository and SSH key management by setting "repo-manager" to "none".
For more details, please refer to the :doc:`repository management page
</managing/repositories>` in the documentation.

git:api-server
++++++++++++++

``git:api-server`` is the address of the Gandalf API. It should define the
entire address, including protocol and port. Examples of value:
``http://localhost:9090`` and ``https://gandalf.tsuru.io:9595``.

Authentication configuration
----------------------------

tsuru has support for ``native``, ``oauth`` and ``saml`` authentication schemes.

The default scheme is ``native`` and it supports the creation of users in
tsuru's internal database. It hashes passwords brcypt. Tokens are generated
during authentication and are hashed using SHA512.

The ``auth`` section also controls whether user registration is on or off. When
user registration is off, only admin users are able to create new users.

auth:scheme
+++++++++++

The authentication scheme to be used. The default value is ``native``, the other
supported value is ``oauth``.

auth:user-registration
++++++++++++++++++++++

This flag indicates whether user registration is enabled. This setting is
optional, and defaults to false.

auth:hash-cost
++++++++++++++

Required only with ``native`` chosen as ``auth:scheme``.

This number indicates how many CPU time you're willing to give to hashing
calculation. It is an absolute number, between 4 and 31, where 4 is faster and
less secure, while 31 is very secure and *very* slow.

auth:token-expire-days
++++++++++++++++++++++

Required only with ``native`` chosen as ``auth:scheme``.

Whenever a user logs in, tsuru generates a token for him/her, and the user may
store the token. ``auth:token-expire-days`` setting defines the amount of days
that the token will be valid. This setting is optional, and defaults to "7".

auth:max-simultaneous-sessions
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

tsuru can limit the number of simultaneous sessions per user. This setting is
optional, and defaults to "unlimited".

auth:oauth
++++++++++

Every config entry inside ``auth:oauth`` are used when the ``auth:scheme`` is
set to "oauth". Please check `rfc6749 <http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749>`_ for
more details.

auth:oauth:client-id
++++++++++++++++++++

The client id provided by your OAuth server.

auth:oauth:client-secret
++++++++++++++++++++++++

The client secret provided by your OAuth server.

auth:oauth:scope
++++++++++++++++

The scope for your authentication request.

auth:oauth:auth-url
+++++++++++++++++++

The URL used in the authorization step of the OAuth flow. tsuru CLI will receive
this URL and trigger the opening a browser on this URL with the necessary
parameters.

During the authorization step, tsuru CLI will start a server locally and set the
callback to http://localhost:<port>, if ``auth:oauth:callback-port`` is set
tsuru CLI will use its value as <port>. If ``auth:oauth:callback-port`` isn't
present tsuru CLI will automatically choose an open port.

The callback URL should be registered on your OAuth server.

If the chosen server requires the callback URL to match the same host and port
as the registered one you should register "http://localhost:<chosen port>" and
set the ``auth:oauth:callback-port`` accordingly.

If the chosen server is more lenient and allows a different port to be used you
should register simply "http://localhost" and leave ``auth:oauth:callback-port``
empty.

auth:oauth:token-url
++++++++++++++++++++

The URL used in the exchange token step of the OAuth flow.

auth:oauth:info-url
+++++++++++++++++++

The URL used to fetch information about the authenticated user. tsuru expects a
json response containing a field called ``email``.

tsuru will also make call this URL on every request to the API to make sure the
token is still valid and hasn't been revoked.

auth:oauth:collection
+++++++++++++++++++++

The database collection used to store valid access tokens. Defaults to
"oauth_tokens".

auth:oauth:callback-port
++++++++++++++++++++++++

The port used in the callback URL during the authorization step. Check docs for
``auth:oauth:auth-url`` for more details.

.. _saml_configuration:

auth:saml
+++++++++

Every config entry inside ``auth:saml`` are used when the ``auth:scheme`` is
set to "saml". Please check `SAML V2.0 specification <http://saml.xml.org/saml-specifications>`_ for
more details.

Boolean value that indicates to identity provider signs the response.
The default value is `false`.

auth:saml:idp-deflate-encoding
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Boolean value that indicates to identity provider to enable deflate encoding.
The default value is `false`.

.. _config_queue:

Queue configuration
-------------------

tsuru uses a work queue for asynchronous tasks.

``queue:*`` groups configuration settings for a MongoDB server that will be used
as storage for delayed execution of queued jobs.

This queue is used to manage creation and destruction of IaaS machines, but
tsuru may start using it in more places in the future.

It's not mandatory to configure the queue, however creating and removing
machines using a IaaS provider will not be possible.

queue:mongo-url
+++++++++++++++

Connection url for MongoDB server used to store task information.

queue:mongo-database
++++++++++++++++++++

Database name used in MongoDB. This value will take precedence over any database
name already specified in the connection url.

.. _config_pubsub:

pubsub
++++++

Deprecated: These settings are obsolete and are ignored as of tsuru 1.3.0.

.. _config_admin_user:

Quota management
----------------

tsuru can, optionally, manage quotas. Currently, there are two available
quotas: apps per user and units per app.

tsuru administrators can control the default quota for new users and new apps
in the configuration file, and use ``tsuru`` command to change quotas for
users or apps. Quota management is disabled by default, to enable it, just set
the desired quota to a positive integer.

quota:units-per-app
+++++++++++++++++++

``quota:units-per-app`` is the default value for units per-app quota. All new
apps will have at most the number of units specified by this setting. This
setting is optional, and defaults to "unlimited".

quota:apps-per-user
+++++++++++++++++++

``quota:apps-per-user`` is the default value for apps per-user quota. All new
users will have at most the number of apps specified by this setting. This
setting is optional, and defaults to "unlimited".

.. _config_logging:

Logging
-------

Tsuru supports three logging flavors, that can be enabled or disabled
altogether. The default behavior of tsuru is to send all logs to syslog, but it
can also send logs to the standard error stream or a file. It's is possible to
use any combination of the three flavors at any time in tsuru configuration
(e.g.: write logs both to stderr and syslog, or a file and stderr, or to all of
the flavors simultaneously).

There's also the possibility to enable or disable debugging log, via the debug
flag.

debug
+++++

``false`` is the default value, so you won't see any
noises on logs, to turn it on set it to true, e.g.: ``debug: true``

++++++++

Use this to specify a path to a log file. If no file is specified, tsuru-server
won't write logs to any file.

log:disable-syslog
++++++++++++++++++

``log:disable-syslog`` indicates whether tsuru-server should disable the use of
syslog. ``false`` is the default value. If it's ``true``, tsuru-server won't
send any logs to syslog.

Defining the provisioner
------------------------

tsuru has extensible support for provisioners. A provisioner is a Go type that
satisfies the `provision.Provisioner` interface. By default, tsuru will use
``DockerProvisioner`` (identified by the string "docker"). Other provisioners
are available as **experiments** and may be removed in future versions:
``swarm`` and ``kubernetes``.

.. _config_provisioner:

provisioner

will be tagged in docker as <docker:repository-namespace>/<platform-name> and
<docker:repository-namespace>/<app-name>. The default value is 'tsuru'.

docker:max-layers
+++++++++++++++++

The maximum number of layers in Docker images. This number represents the
number of times that Tsuru will reuse the previous image on application
deployment. The default value is 10.

.. _config_bs:

docker:bs:image
+++++++++++++++

This setting is deprecated in favor of dynamically configuring with
``tsuru node-container-update big-sibling --image <image>``.

docker:bs:socket
++++++++++++++++

This setting is deprecated in favor of dynamically configuring with
``tsuru node-container-update big-sibling --volume <local>:<remote> --env
DOCKER_ENDPOINT=<remote>``.

docker:bs:syslog-port
+++++++++++++++++++++

``docker:bs:syslog-port`` is the port in the Docker node that will be used by
the bs container for collecting logs. The default value is 1514.

If this value is changed bs node containers must be update with ``tsuru
node-container-update big-sibling --env
SYSLOG_LISTEN_ADDRESS=udp://0.0.0.0:<port>``.

docker:max-workers
++++++++++++++++++

Maximum amount of threads to be created when starting new containers, so tsuru
doesn't start too much threads in the process of starting 1000 units, for
instance. Defaults to 0 which means unlimited.

docker:nodecontainer:max-workers
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Same as ``docker:max-workers`` but applies only to when starting new node containers.
Defaults to 0 which means unlimited.

.. _config_docker_router:

docker:router
+++++++++++++

Default router to be used to distribute requests to units. This should be the
name of a router configured under the ``routers:<name>`` key, see :ref:`routers
<config_routers>`.

For backward compatibility reasons, the value ``hipache`` is also supported, and
it will use either configuration available under ``router:hipache:*`` or
``hipache:*``, in this order.

The router defined in ``docker:router`` will only be used if there is no router
with `router:<my-router>:default` set to true.

docker:deploy-cmd
+++++++++++++++++

The command that will be called in your platform when a new deploy happens. The
default value for platforms supported in tsuru's basebuilder repository is
``/var/lib/tsuru/deploy``.

docker:security-opts
++++++++++++++++++++

This setting describes a list of security options that will be passed to
containers. This setting must be a list, and has no default value. If one wants
to specify just one value, it's still needed to use the list notation:

.. highlight: yaml

::

    docker:
      ...
      security-opts:
        - apparmor:PROFILE

For more details on the available options, please refer to the Docker
documentation: <https://docs.docker.com/reference/run/#security-configuration>.

docker:segregate
++++++++++++++++

Deprecated. As of tsuru 0.11.1, using segregate scheduler is the default
setting. See :doc:`/managing/segregate-scheduler` for details.

.. _config_scheduler_memory:

docker:scheduler:total-memory-metadata
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

This value describes which metadata key will describe the total amount of
memory, in bytes, available to a docker node.

docker:scheduler:max-used-memory
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

This should be a value between 0.0 and 1.0 which describes which fraction of the
total amount of memory available to a server should be reserved for app units.

The amount of memory available is found based on the node metadata described by
``docker:scheduler:total-memory-metadata`` config setting.

If this value is set, tsuru will try to find a node with enough unreserved
memory to fit the creation of new units, based on how much memory is required by
the plan used to create the application. If no node with enough unreserved
memory is found, tsuru will ignore memory restrictions and let the scheduler
choose any node.

This setting, along with ``docker:scheduler:total-memory-metadata``, are also
used by node auto scaling. See :doc:`node auto scaling
</advanced_topics/node_scaling>` for more details.

.. _config_cluster_storage:

docker:cluster:storage
++++++++++++++++++++++

This setting has been removed. You shouldn't define it anymore, the only storage
available for the docker cluster is now ``mongodb``.

default value expected by platforms defined in tsuru's basebuilder repository is
``8888``.

docker:user
+++++++++++

The user tsuru will use to start the container. The default value is
``ubuntu``, which is the expected value for default tsuru platforms. An empty
for this will make tsuru use the platform image user.

docker:uid
+++++++++++
