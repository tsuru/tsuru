Development environment
=======================

See this guide to :doc:`to setup a development environment using vagrant </contributing/vagrant>`.

And follow our :doc:`coding style guide </contributing/coding-style>`.

Running the tests
=================

You can use `make` to install all tsuru dependencies and run tests. It will also check if everything is ok with your `GOPATH` setup:

.. highlight:: bash

::

    $ make

Please ensure yourself that MongoDB and Redis are started before running the tests (if you are seeing some failing tests the most likely reason is that these services are not started).

If you just want to run the tests you can use `make test`. 

.. highlight:: bash

::

    $ make test

Writing docs
============

tsuru documentation is written using `Sphinx <http://sphinx.pocoo.org/>`_,
which uses `RST <http://docutils.sourceforge.net/rst.html>`_.
Check these tools docs to learn how to write docs for tsuru.

Building docs
=============

In order to build the HTML docs, just run on terminal:

.. highlight:: bash

::

    $ make doc
