Release Process
===============

We use GitHub's milestones to releases' planning and anyone is free to
suggest an issue to a milestone, and discuss about any issue in the next tsuru
release.

At globo.com, we have goals by quarter of a year (short term goals below), but
it doesn't mean that there's only one release per quarter. We also have internal
goals and our focus will be on these. But they are not immutable and we can 
change any goal at any time as community need. Our releases have one or more
main issues and minor issues which can be minor bugfixes, ground work issue
and other "not so important but needed" issues.

You can suggest any issue to any milestones at any time, and we'll
discuss it in the issue or in `Gitter <https://gitter.im/tsuru/tsuru>`_.
