Installing tsuru components
===========================

This document will describe how to install each component separately.
We assume that tsuru is being installed on an Ubuntu Server 14.04 LTS 64-bit
machine. This is currently the supported environment for tsuru, you may try
running it on other environments, but there's a chance it won't be a smooth
ride.
