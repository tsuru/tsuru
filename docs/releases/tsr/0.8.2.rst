tsr 0.8.2 release notes
=======================

Welcome to tsr 0.8.2!

These release notes cover the `bug fixes`_ you'll want to be aware of when
upgrading from tsr 0.8.1 or older versions.

Bug fixes
=========

* Requests to services using the proxy api call (/services/proxy/{instance}) now
  send the Host header of the original service endpoint. This allow proxied
  requests to be made to service apis running on tsuru. This fix is complementary
  to those made in proxy requests in 0.8.1.
