tsr 0.7.0 release notes
=======================

Welcome to tsr 0.7.0!

These release notes cover the `new features`_, `bug fixes`_ and `backward
incompatible changes`_ you'll want to be aware of when upgrading from tsr 0.6.0
or older versions.

.. _`new features`: `What's new in tsr 0.7.0`_

What's new in tsr 0.7.0
=======================

- quota management via API is back: now tsuru administrators are able to view
  and change the quota of a user of an application. It can be done from the
  remote API or using tsuru-admin (issue `#869
  <https://github.com/tsuru/tsuru/issues/869>`_)
- deploy via upload: now it's possible to upload a tar archive to the API. In
  this case, users are able to just drop the file in the tsuru server, without
  using git. This feature enables the deployment of binaries, WAR files, and
  other things that may need local processing (issue `#874
  <https://github.com/tsuru/tsuru/issues/874>`_). The tsuru client also
  includes a ``tsuru deploy`` command.

Bug fixes
=========

- API: fix the endpoint for creating new services so it returns 409 Conflict
  instead of 500 when there's already a service registered with the provided
  name

Backward incompatible changes
=============================

- ``tsr ssh-agent`` has been totally removed, it's no longe possible to use it
  with tsuru server
