    * Refactored quota backend.
    * New lisp platform. Thanks to Nick Ricketts.

Backwards incompatible changes
==============================

Tsuru 0.3.0 handles quota in a brand new way. Users upgrading from 0.2.x need
to run a migration script in the database. There are two scripts available: one
for installations with quota enabled and other for installations without quota.

The easiest script is recommended for environments where quota is disabled,
you'll need to run just a couple of commands in MongoDB:

.. highlight:: bash

::

    % mongo tsuru
    MongoDB shell version: x.x.x
    connecting to: tsuru
    > db.users.update({}, {$set: {quota: {limit: -1}}});
    > db.apps.update({}, {$set: {quota: {limit: -1}}});

In environments where quota is enabled, the script is longer, but still simple:

.. highlight:: javascript

::

    db.quota.find().forEach(function(quota) {
        if(quota.owner.indexOf("@") > -1) {
            db.users.update({email: quota.owner}, {$set: {quota: {limit: quota.limit, inuse: quota.items.length}}});
        } else {
            db.apps.update({name: quota.owner}, {$set: {quota: {limit: quota.limit, inuse: quota.items.length}}});
        }
    });

db.apps.update({quota: null}, {$set: {quota: {limit: -1}}});
db.users.update({quota: null}, {$set: {quota: {limit: -1}}});
db.quota.remove()

The best way to run it is saving it to a file and invoke MongoDB with the file
parameter:

.. highlight:: bash

::

    % mongo tsuru <filename.js>
