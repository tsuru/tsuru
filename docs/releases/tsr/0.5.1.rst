tsr 0.5.1 release notes
=======================

Welcome to tsr 0.5.1!

These release notes cover the `new features`_, `bug fixes`_ and `backwards incompatible
changes`_ you'll want to be aware of when upgrading from tsr 0.5.0 or older
versions.

.. _`new features`: `What's new in tsr 0.5.1`_

What's new in tsr 0.5.1
=======================

* **tsr api** now checks tsuru.conf file and refuse to start if it is
  misconfigured. It's also possible to exclusively test the config file with
  the -t flag.  i.e.: running "tsr api -t". (`#714
  <https://github.com/tsuru/tsuru/issues/714>`_).
* new command in the ``tsuru-admin``: the command fix-containers will look for
  broken containers and fix their configuration within the router, and in the
  database

Bug fixes
=========

* Do not lock application on ``tsuru run``

Backwards incompatible changes
==============================

* **tsr collector** is no more. In the 0.5.0 release, collector got much less
  responsibilities, and now it does nothing, because it no longer exists. The
  last of its responsibilities is now available in the ``tsuru-admin
  fix-containers`` command.
