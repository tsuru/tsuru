.. _new-1.5.0:

New features
============

Kubernetes Ingress/Service router
---------------------------------

`Kubernetes-router <https://github.com/tsuru/kubernetes-router>`_ is an standalone project that is fully
compatible with tsuru Router API and aims to manage kubernetes services and ingresses resources for a given app.
This can be used to leverage cloud Load Balancers.

App Build (`#1521 <https://github.com/tsuru/tsuru/issues/1521>`_)
-----------------------------------------------------------------

This feature adds support for a new workflow for deploying applications to tsuru. This decouples
the build and the deploy step, allowing the user to build an application image and deploying it at a later time.
This also makes easier to reuse an app image across different applications, e.g: 

1. Build app1-dev image
2. Deploy app1-dev using the built image
3. Test the application in a dev environment
4. Deploy the same image to app1-prod

Other improvements
==================

* Support for different schemes in app healthcheck

* Several improvements to the Kubernetes provisioner, including:

  * Support for memory overcommit (`10722bf <https://github.com/tsuru/tsuru/commit/10722bf1fa8cacbfc411717c24084399788bbc05>`_ and `5b5cfe8 <https://github.com/tsuru/tsuru/commit/5b5cfe8ab4fa7c6c068b9507ffa04085f6b7eb7d>`_)
  * Use app healthcheck as liveness probe (`a5aa11a <https://github.com/tsuru/tsuru/commit/a5aa11a81e271e17f1bd26511926ad1589cb6868>`_)
  * Support for non persistent volumes (`8bbe524 <https://github.com/tsuru/tsuru/commit/8bbe524847528922c6b0da3cb2db91c37da5dfc5>`_)

* Support for running tsuru API listening both http and https (`29b3760 <https://github.com/tsuru/tsuru/commit/29b37600e081c74eafebdcd225964fa947ab4852>`_)
