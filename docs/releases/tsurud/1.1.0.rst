tsurud 1.1.0 release notes
==========================

Welcome to tsurud 1.1.0!

These release notes cover the :ref:`new features <new-1.1.0>`, :ref:`bug fixes
<bug-1.1.0>` and :ref:`required migrations <migrations-1.1.0>`.

.. _new-1.1.0:

New features
============

* New event track system
  (`#1424 <https://github.com/tsuru/tsuru/issues/1424>`_).

* Support for cancelable events, right now, only the deploy event is cancelable.
  This means users can use the ``tsuru event-cancel`` command to ask for the
  cancellation of a deploy. tsuru will do it's best to try cancelling it.

.. _migrations-1.1.0:

Required migrations
===================

* Due to the new event tracking system, simply installing the new version of
  tsurud will cause deploy list and healing list to be empty. Running ``tsurud
  migrate`` will fix this by migrating deploys and healings to the new event
  system.

.. _bug-1.1.0:

Bug fixes
=========

* allow setting timeout waiting for status update in galeb router
  (`#1427 <https://github.com/tsuru/tsuru/issues/1427>`_).

* `user-list` and `user-info` display users without roles
  (`#1390 <https://github.com/tsuru/tsuru/issues/1390>`_).

* handling rollbacks to non-existing versions
  (`#1416 <https://github.com/tsuru/tsuru/issues/1416>`_).
