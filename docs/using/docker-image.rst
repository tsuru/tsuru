Overview
========

This document is a hands-on guide to deploy a simple Docker Image web application.

Creating the app
================

To create an app, you need to use the command `app-create`:

.. highlight:: bash

::

    $ tsuru app-create <app-name> <app-platform>

For Docker Images, doesn't exist a specific platform, but we can use ``static``! Let's be over creative and develop a hello
world tutorial-app, let's call it "helloworld":

.. highlight:: bash

::

    $ tsuru app-create helloworld static

To list all available platforms, use the command `platform-list`.

You can see all your applications using the command  `app-list`:

.. highlight:: bash

::

    $ tsuru app-list
    +-------------+-------------------------+--------------------------------+
    | Application | Units State Summary     | Address                        |
    +-------------+-------------------------+--------------------------------+
    | helloworld  | 0 of 0 units in-service | helloworld.192.168.50.4.nip.io |
    +-------------+-------------------------+--------------------------------+

Application code
================

A simple `Dockerfile`:

.. highlight:: Dockerfile

::

    FROM golang
    RUN mkdir /app
    WORKDIR /app
    ADD . /app/
    RUN go build .
    ENTRYPOINT ./app
    
.. note::
    Notice that you do not have to EXPOSE a port in your Dockerfile.
    When a EXPOSE clause is used, the port mapping goes to the exposed port.
    Make sure to not expose more than one port. This will make the deployment fail.
    If you do not expose a port, the port is mapped to the $PORT environment variable.

A simple web application in Go `main.go`:

.. highlight:: go

::

    package main

    import (
        "fmt"
        "net/http"
        "os"
    )

    func main() {
        c := make(chan os.Signal, 1)
        signal.Notify(c, os.Interrupt)
        go func(){
            for sig := range c {
                if sig == os.Interrupt || sig == os.Kill {
                    os.Exit(1)
                }
            }
        }()
        http.HandleFunc("/", hello)
        fmt.Println("running on "+os.Getenv("PORT"))
        http.ListenAndServe(":"+os.Getenv("PORT"), nil)
    }

    func hello(res http.ResponseWriter, req *http.Request) {
        fmt.Fprintln(res, "hello, world!")
    }
    
.. note::
    The app should listen to $PORT or to the exposed port.


Building the image
==================

.. highlight:: bash

::

    docker login registry.myserver.com

    docker build -t registry.myserver.com/image-name .


Don't forget the dot(.) at the end of the command, this indicates where the Dockerfile is placed

Sending the image to registry
=============================

.. highlight:: bash

::

    docker push registry.myserver.com/image-name


Docker Image deployment
=======================

After pushing your image to your Docker image registry, you can do the deploy using the command `tsuru app-deploy -i`.

.. highlight:: bash

::

    tsuru app-deploy -i registry.myserver.com/image-name -a helloworld


.. note::

    This image should be in a registry and be accessible by the nodes.
    Image should also have a Entrypoint or a Procfile at given paths, / or /app/user/ or /home/application/current


Running the application
=======================

Now that the app is deployed, you can access it from your browser, getting the
IP or host listed in ``app-list`` and opening it. For example,
in the list below:

::

    $ tsuru app-list
    +-------------+-------------------------+--------------------------------+
    | Application | Units State Summary     | Address                        |
    +-------------+-------------------------+--------------------------------+
    | helloworld  | 1 of 1 units in-service | helloworld.192.168.50.4.nip.io |
    +-------------+-------------------------+--------------------------------+

It's done! Now we have a simple Docker image project deployed on tsuru.

Now we can access your app in the URL displayed in `app-list`
("helloworld.192.168.50.4.nip.io" in this case).

Going further
