Deploying PHP applications

Overview
========

This document is a hands-on guide to deploying a simple PHP application in
tsuru. The example application will be a very simple Wordpress project
associated to a MySQL service. It's applicable to any php over apache
application.

Creating the app
================

To create an app, you use the command `app create`:

.. highlight:: bash

::

    $ tsuru app create <app-name> <app-platform> <team>

For PHP, the app platform is, guess what, ``php``! Let's be over creative
and develop a never-developed tutorial-app: a blog, and its name will also be
very creative, let's call it "blog":

.. highlight:: bash

::

    $ tsuru app create blog php --team

To list all available platforms, use the command `platform list`.

You can see all your applications using the command `app list`:

.. highlight:: bash

::

    $ tsuru app list
    +-------------+-------------------------+--------------------------+
    | Application | Units State Summary     | Address                  |
    +-------------+-------------------------+--------------------------+
    | blog        | 0 of 0 units in-service | blog.192.168.50.4.nip.io |
    +-------------+-------------------------+--------------------------+

Application code
================

This document will not focus on how to write a php blog, you can download the
entire source direct from wordpress: http://wordpress.org/latest.zip. Here is
all you need to do with your project:

.. highlight:: bash

::

    # Download and unpack wordpress
    $ wget http://wordpress.org/latest.zip
    $ unzip latest.zip
    # Preparing wordpress for tsuru
    $ cd wordpress
    # Notify tsuru about the necessary packages
    $ echo php5-mysql > requirements.apt
    # Preparing the application to receive the tsuru environment related to the mysql service
    $ sed "s/'database_name_here'/getenv('MYSQL_DATABASE_NAME')/; \
                s/'username_here'/getenv('MYSQL_USER')/; \
                s/'localhost'/getenv('MYSQL_HOST')/; \
                s/'password_here'/getenv('MYSQL_PASSWORD')/" \
                wp-config-sample.php  > wp-config.php


Deployment
==========

You can just run ``tsuru app deploy`` command and your project will be deployed:


.. highlight:: console

::

    $ tsuru app deploy -a blog .
     text
     Deploying the PHP application...
     tar: Removing leading `/' from member names
    #########################################
    #  OMIT DEPENDENCIES STEPS (see below)  #
    #########################################

     ---- Building application image ----
      ---> Sending image to repository (51.40MB)
      ---> Cleaning up

     ---- Starting 1 new unit ----
      ---> Started unit 027c2a31a0...

     ---- Binding and checking 1 new units ----
      ---> Bound and checked unit 027c2a31a0

     ---- Adding routes to 1 new units ----
      ---> Added route to unit 027c2a31a0

     OK


Now you can check your deployed app running `tsuru app info`


.. highlight:: bash

::

    $ tsuru app info -a blog
    Application: blog
    Platform: php
    Teams: admin
    Address: blog.192.168.50.4.nip.io
    Owner: admin@example.com
    Team owner: admin
    Deploys: 1
    Pool: theonepool
    Units: 1
    +----------------------------+---------+
    | Unit                       | State   |
    +----------------------------+---------+
    | blog-web-027c2a31a0-2a31a0 | started |
    +----------------------------+---------+

    App Plan:
    +---------------+--------+-----------+---------+
    | Name          | Memory | Cpu Share | Default |
    +---------------+--------+-----------+---------+
    | autogenerated | 0 MB   | 100       | false   |
    +---------------+--------+-----------+---------+

Listing dependencies
====================

In the last section we omitted the dependencies step of deploy. In tsuru, an
application can have two kinds of dependencies:

* **Operating system dependencies**, represented by packages in the package manager
  of the underlying operating system (e.g.: ``yum`` and ``apt-get``);
* **Platform dependencies**, represented by packages in the package manager of the
  platform/language (e.g. in Python, ``pip``).

All ``apt-get`` dependencies must be specified in a ``requirements.apt`` file,
located in the root of your application, and pip dependencies must be located
in a file called ``requirements.txt``, also in the root of the application.
Since we will use MySQL with PHP, we need to install the package depends on just
one ``apt-get`` package:
``php5-mysql``, so here is how ``requirements.apt``
looks like:

::

    php5-mysql


You can see the complete output of installing these dependencies below:

.. highlight:: bash

::

    % tsuru app deploy -a blog .

      ---> App will be restarted, please check its log for more details...

Running the application
=======================

As you can see, in the deploy output there is a step described as "App will be
restarted". In this step, tsuru will restart your app if it's running, or start
it if it's not.
Now that the app is deployed, you can access it from your browser, getting the
IP or host listed in ``app list`` and opening it. For example,
in the list below:

::

    $ tsuru app list
    +-------------+-------------------------+---------------------+
    | Application | Units State Summary     | Address             |
    +-------------+-------------------------+---------------------+
    | blog        | 1 of 1 units in-service | blog.cloud.tsuru.io |
    +-------------+-------------------------+---------------------+


Customizing the platform
========================

The PHP platform supports customizations in the frontend and the interpreter,
for more details, check the `README of the platform
<https://github.com/tsuru/basebuilder/blob/master/php/README.md>`_.

Going further
=============

For more information, you can dig into `tsuru docs <http://docs.tsuru.io>`_, or
read `complete instructions of use for the tsuru command
<https://tsuru.readthedocs.org>`_.
